 This project started with video mirror inspiration from lovoshiv.

 For my final project, I've been thinking about a concept that is like a DIY art gallery with generative art. It would build on what on what we already learned and include many interactive controls for the user to experiment with and then hopefully an option to save their creation, but I had yet to see a p5 example of saving the canvas.
 
 I was excited when I saw this video mirror example because it incorporates many of the elements I was thinking about for my final project and it taught me how to save the canvas. 
 
 I started by using the p5.js site references to understand each component of lovoshiv's video mirror. 
 
 When it came to the pixel array with nested for loops, Daniel Schiffman's The Coding Train video helped me finally grasp the topic. 
 I then felt comfortable writing the code myself with an understanding of the formula used.

 In starting my project, I learned how to set up the canvas to take up the whole screen size, and to resize itself automatically if the window is resized. 
 
 I experimented with different slider functions. I knew I wanted to have at least 3. I quickly saw opportunities to change the circle size, spacing between circles and background color. For awhile, I played around with using a slider to change the R value in RGBA, which resulted in a teal to red spectrum. I tried a few different ways to create a saturation slider that you could use to change the video on the spectrum from color to black and white. I hoped it would be as easy as changing colorMode to HSB and linking the slider to the S value, but I struggled to convert the RGB values to hue. It does seem possible with some longer formulas, but I didn't want to get that deep into it because I like to have a solid handling on how each line of code works. In the end, I realized changing the A value would be easy. While experimenting with it, I liked the results more than I expected because of the way the circles overlap with some of the settings. 
 
I wanted to label the sliders because even I was forgetting which one did which. A little googling taught me to add a label in a Div and styling in with CSS. I also changed the font to sans-serif and displayed them with inline-block. 

I made the image save as a jpg because my old photographer habits die hard.
